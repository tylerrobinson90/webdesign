            <p class="classP">The BAE Systems Hawk is a British single-engine, jet-powered advanced trainer aircraft. It
                has been used
                in a training capacity and as a low-cost combat aircraft. Operators of the Hawk include the Royal Air
                Force (notably the Red Arrows display team) and a considerable number of foreign military operators.

            <h2 class="style">Facts</h2>
            <p class="classP">The Hawk T1 is a two-seater jet used for advanced pilot training. The Red Arrows version
                of the aircraft
                is powered by a single Rolls-Royce Turbomeca Adour Mk 861 turbofan which produces 5700lb of thrust. This
                enables the Hawk to travel at an impressive maximum speed of 645 mph. Whilst diving, the Hawk can reach
                a top speed of Mach 1.2. Aside from its paint scheme the Red Arrows Hawk has little difference when
                compared to the T MK1. However, each aircraft carries a ventral 318Itr tank containing diesel oil as
                well as red and blue dye, which is divided into separate compartments. On selection, these fluids are
                pumped into three jet pipe nozzles where the hot temperature produces the smoke.
